# PHP ImageResize with WebP

Thanks to Ben Major for his work: https://github.com/benmajor/PHP-Image-Resize put into MIT.

I adapt it to support the newer image format WebP. I also remove any support for bmp, tmp. Maybe I do some more changes. Check out the code differences.  

I removed all other files than src/ImageResize.php. I only focus on that script. Thats not best practice of forking I guess. Maybe someone likes to make a cleaner fork with support for WebP.  

License goes from MIT to JSON. (JSON License = MIT + Ethics)

Find manual, examples, etc. in the original repository from Ben. He did it very well I think.
