# PHP ImageResize with WebP

Thanks to Ben Major for his work: https://github.com/benmajor/PHP-Image-Resize put into MIT.

At first I wanted to add support for the newer image format 'WebP'. I ended up to modify quite a bit. Check out the code differences.  

This version uses public class vars, the output function takes a filename, cache, watermark and text removed, etc.  

I removed all the other files. Only 'ImageResize.php' for direct including. 

License goes from MIT to JSON. (JSON License = MIT + Ethics)

Find manual, examples, etc. in the original repository from Ben. He did it very well I think.

Now testing...
